# Random Name Generator

A python programme that takes a list of names and returns a n number of random names.

## Description

The script takes a list of user-generated names, takes a number of names to return and uses the random library to return a random list of names.
### Dependencies

* Requires the random module that comes with Python


## Help

This code is simple, so it should be pretty straightforward.

# Beginners Python Project - Random Name Generator
Building a Random Name Generator application.
## Introduction 
In this project, you will be building a text-based user interface that will take a input and output a list of random names from a pre-defined list. 

## Learning Objects
- User inputs
- Validating inputs
- Importing packages
- Documenting code 
- Writing functions
- Control flows
- Printing outputs to the user
- Using random functionality in Python
- Basic structure of Python Scripts

## Project Brief
This application will simulate randomly generating names from a pre-defined list. A use case could be: a set of new parents can't choose a name from a shortlist. Why not use Python to help! 

The application will: 
- Take a user input of shortlist names.
- Take a second user input of how many names they want randomly selected from that shortlist. This should be a positive integer. The app should check if the input is valid.
- Print to the user the randomly selected names. 

## Suggestions
Feel free to structure the application however you see fit, but here is a project structure recommendation. If you have experience with pseudocode or flowcharts, I would recommend mapping out the project using these tools before you start any programming. 

I would also recommend using Visual Studio Code as your editor, but this is personal preference. Make sure you implement coding standards and Pythonic style in the application!

Suggested Structure:
- Contain all code in one main.py file. Could also be a .ipynb file. 
- A README file consisting of project documentation. I would recommend a .md file.
- Read the user's input using Python's inbuilt input() function i.e. multiple calls to input().
- A user-defined function that validates and parses the user's input. Think of a appropriate function name and appropriate checks.
- A user-defined function that uses Python's random package to select the names from the shortlist. Think of a appropriate function name.
- Prints the shortlisted names to the user.

## Good Luck!
