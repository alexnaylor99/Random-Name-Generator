# Random Name Generator
This is a simple Python script that generates a list of random names based on a user-provided name using the random-word API. 

The script prompts the user for a name and the number of examples to generate, and then displays the list of names along with a randomly selected favorite name.

## Prerequisites
To run this script, you will need Python 3 installed on your local machine. You will also need to install the [requests]([https://www.google.com](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)) library to make API calls. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install requests
```

## How to Run
To run the script, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved. Then, run the following command:

```
python3 random_name_generator.py
```

Follow the prompts to provide a name and the number of examples to generate.
