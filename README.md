# Beginners Python Project - Random Name Generator
Building a Random Name Generator application.

## Learning Objects
- User inputs
- Validating inputs
- Importing packages
- Documenting code 
- Writing functions
- Control flows
- Printing outputs to the user
- Using random functionality in Python
- Basic structure of Python Scripts

## Project Brief
This application with simulate randomly generating names from a pre-defined list. A use case could be: a set of new parents can't choose a name from a shortlist. Why not use Python to help! 

The application will: 
- Take a user input of shortlist names.
- Take a second user input of how many names they want randomly selected from that shortlist. This should be a positive integer. The app should check if the input is valid.
- Print to the user the randomly selected names.

## What did I learn?

I got to work with pure python again which I haven't done for quite a while. 
I also used more Pseudocode in the early stages along with commenting the criteria at the top of the file to keep me on track.

I realised as well I need a lot more practice and so will be reviewing more content and trying other small challenges and projects in the near future.

The mindset for problem solving is still challenging for me and so I hope more projects like this will improve that.
