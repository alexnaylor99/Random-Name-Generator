# Random Name Generator

## Introduction 
In this project, a text-based user interface that will take a input and output a list of random names from a pre-defined list was built. 

## Project Brief
This application will simulate random names from a pre-defined list. A use case could be: a set of new parents can't choose a name from a shortlist. Why not use Python to help! 

The application will: 
- Take a user input of shortlist names.
- Take a second user input of how many names they want randomly selected from that shortlist. This should be a positive integer. The app should check if the input is valid.
- Print to the user the randomly selected names.
